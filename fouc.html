        <h3>Why do wizards need money if they could just create it?</h3>

      <pfe-accordion-panel>
        <p>
          There is legislation that decides what you can conjure and what you
          can not. Because things that you conjure out of thin air will not
          last, it is illegal in the wizarding world.

        <h3>Why doesn't Harry have a portrait of his parents?</h3>
      </pfe-accordion-header>
      <pfe-accordion-panel>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com">The characters in the portraits</a> are not actually
          ghosts. They mainly are there just to repeat common phrases or serve
          as a general
          <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com">representation of the individual</a> they
          depict. A portrait of his parents would not be of much help to Harry.

        <h3>Why is Harry considered a half-blood if both of his parents could use magic?</h3>
      </pfe-accordion-header>
      <pfe-accordion-panel>
        <p>
          Because Harry's grandparents were not able to do magic. This is
          generally frowned upon by those who consider themselves pure, such as
          the Malfoy's or other antagonists.

          No! It has been revealed that there are actually 11 long established
          and prestigious schools around the globe. These include Castelobruxo
          in the rainforest of Brazil, Durmstrang Institute (whereas nobody is
          certain of itâ€™s whereabouts), and Ilvermorny, right here in the United
          States.

          Harry and Hermione are at the Ministry: he ends up leading the Auror
          department. Ron helps George at the joke shop and does very well.
          Ginny becomes a professional Quidditch player and then sportswriter
          for the Daily Prophet.
